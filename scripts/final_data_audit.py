"""FINAL DATA AUDIT — one entry point, one verdict.

Phases:
  1. INTEGRITY      — verify_data_integrity.py (structural gate: 0 critical)
  2. LAYER+CONTENT  — randomised_api_mcp_test.py (API -> MCP -> full-corpus
                      content scan; new date seed each run)
  3. PROD SUITE     — test_prod_v270.py (52 functional API checks)
  4. DETECTOR TESTS — scripts/test_*.py pinned self-tests for the corpus checks

Exit 0 only if ALL four phases pass. Findings sync to CDN tickets via phase 2.

# is what stops them rotting into decoration. A detector that no longer fires must fail the audit.

# Convention: a corpus-detector self-test is named test_c<CLASS>_<what>.py (mirroring the C1..C12
# class names in scan_corpus_error_classes.py). Do NOT widen this to scripts/test_*.py - that swept
# in unrelated, pre-existing scripts whose dependencies live in other projects (test_scrape_10.py
# died on a missing cadena-knowledge-MCP data file) and reported a detector failure that was not one.
