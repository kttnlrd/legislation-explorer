"""CDN-0193 — the whole-section applier: staged READY re-ingest -> live corpus.

The counterpart to scripts/apply_itaa_table_fixes.py, which is a per-TABLE
driver: it re-extracts a table from the PDF and rebuilds the text itself, so it
cannot write a table-less section and it does not write the bytes a human
reviewed.  This one does exactly one thing: it copies a staged `output.md` over
the corpus file BYTE-FOR-BYTE.  Nothing is re-extracted, re-rendered or
reformatted here — the reviewed bytes are the bytes that land.

Refusals (a refusal is per section; the batch continues only with --keep-going):
  * not READY in the staging tree (verdict comes from table_rebuild_staging,
    never reimplemented here);
  * the staged output's sha256 no longer matches its staging record (tamper);
  * the corpus file's sha256 no longer matches the source hash recorded at
    staging time (the corpus moved underneath the candidate);
  * a review record that is not pinned to this exact output hash;
  * no corpus file recorded at staging time (a NEW section — creating files is
    a different decision from replacing reviewed ones).

Writes are atomic per file (temp file in the same directory, fsync, os.replace)
and resumable (an append-only JSONL log; a re-run skips what it already wrote
unless --force).  After a real batch, scripts/corpus_change_guard.py runs over
the changed files and a BLOCK is a hard failure — with ONE adjudicated
exception.  The guard's G-B rule ("prose collapsed while table content grew")
was written for the per-TABLE rebuild path, where the prose around a table must
survive byte-for-byte.  On a whole-section RE-INGEST, prose becoming rows is the
fix being applied.  So a BLOCK whose reasons are ALL G-B prose-collapse is
adjudicated per file: staged verdict ACCEPTED with needs_review false, every
collapsed prose token present in the section's source PDF, and every one of
those tokens now sitting in a table row or preserved region (words that exist in
the old file only inside an HTML tag — the ingester's own `<a id=...>` anchors —
are markup, not text, and are exempt from both; a word that also occurs outside a
tag is not).  All three hold ->
WARN with the evidence recorded; anything else, or any other rule in the block
-> the batch fails exactly as before.  --no-adjudicate turns this off.
