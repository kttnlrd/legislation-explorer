"""Restore the ruling + case embeddings the local pipeline deleted.

scripts/embed_legislation.py computed its "stale" set as

    existing_files - seen_files      # seen_files = only the directories it walks

so every row whose file_path lay outside data/*/sections - i.e. every ruling and case row - was
treated as "the file is gone" and deleted, even though nothing was missing.  It removed 260,297
rows: 248,792 ruling, 8,468 case, 2,244 section, 793 commentary.

The ruling and case rows are restored here from the 2026-08-30 backup, which holds them at the
same model and dimension (text-embedding-3-small / 1536), so no API call and no cost.  The
section/commentary rows in that backup are NOT restored: their file_path values no longer exist
in the corpus (the layout moved), so they would be dangling; the live section/commentary rows were
re-embedded from the current corpus instead.
