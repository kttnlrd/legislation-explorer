"""C15 must fire on a drawing character inside a fence and stay silent outside one.

A detector that cannot fail is decoration, so this points the scanner at a scratch corpus and
asserts both directions.  It also proves the positive control the class was written for is a real
hit rather than a pattern that matches everything.
