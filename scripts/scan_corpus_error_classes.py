# Two shapes are flagged, both of which only a broken extraction produces:
#   (a) a line that is nothing but asterisks (2 or more) — genuine noise in every case;
#   (b) a '*' line mentioning a footnote marker — a real PDF artifact shape that has no
#       hits in the corpus today; kept as a live check, not decoration.
#
# RETIRED 2026-09-21 (CDN-0199): the third alternative, `\*+ *[A-Za-z]+\s*\*+`
# (an emphasis-wrapped word). Measured over the live corpus: 18 findings, 18 false
# positives. Every one was legitimate content — the Act's own emphasis subheadings
# rendered as markdown emphasis on a line of their own (`**Defence**`, `*Exception*`,
# `*Partner*`/`*Beneficiary*`/`*Trustee*`, `**Object**`, `*Application*`/`**List**`/
# `*Objects*`), or defined-term asterisk markers INSIDE ```ingest-unclassified``` /
# ```ingest-formula``` fences, where the text is literal and never markdown emphasis.
# The shape it was written for — a stranded bold fragment left behind when a table cell
# was split (`**and**` / `**expenditure**` in itaa-1997, fixed by hand on 2026-08-30 in
# commit 620032e8b) — is STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL to those subheadings and fence markers,
# so no pattern can tell them apart. Stranded-marker noise stays covered by
# C8_stray_bullet (`^[ \t]*[-*][ \t]*$` in ARTIFACT_PATS) and by (a) above.
#
# `^[ \t]*` rather than `^\s*` (both anchors): in re.M, `\s` matches the newline itself,
# so a match could BEGIN on the preceding blank line and every reported line number came
# out one too low (51-5.md reported "line 16" for text on line 17). These findings are
# acted on by hand, so the number has to be the asterisk line's own.

# ── C6 (CDN-0081): stray trailing token at cut point (e.g. "payments") ──────
# A cut remnant duplicates the END of a heading: the title was severed at the cut point and the
# trailing token was stranded on the next line as its own two-word-at-most heading. It does NOT
# duplicate the START of the heading.
#
# Every finding this class produced (15, all in nz-master-tax-guide) was one legitimate shape: H1 is
# the heading as printed carrying its paragraph number ("Fishing gear and quotas ¶27-371") and H2 is
# the short topic heading the guide prints beneath it ("Fishing gear"). The H2 repeats the START of
# H1 - the topic - which is the act's own convention, so the check was reporting the guide's layout
# as damage while never seeing the shape it was written for.
#
# Fixed on 2026-09-19: a finding requires the repeated token to be the TRAILING token of H1. Acts
# whose headings carry paragraph references are reported by name and skipped, so the correction
# cannot silently become a check that cannot fire - the pinned self-test in
# scripts/test_c6_cut_token.py fails if the CDN-0081 shape stops being caught.

# ── C14 (CDN-0193): formula structure lost - every term present, nothing relating them ──
# Drawn operators (x, -, +, division) are set in subsetted Symbol fonts whose ToUnicode maps them to
# a plain space, so a re-ingested formula keeps the terms and loses the structure between them:
#
#     ```ingest-formula source=vol08.pdf page=160
#     Owned deductions + Acquired deductions        *Corporate tax rate     <- the x is gone
#     ```
#
# A fence whose lines carry a fraction rule is NOT a finding: the rule IS the structure (numerator
# over denominator) and it survives extraction. What is reported is a fence with no operator and no
# rule anywhere - the formula a reader cannot reconstruct. The fence marker names its own source page,
# so every finding is locatable, unlike the gate-derived operator worklist.
#
# Measured 2026-09-19: 963 suspect lines across 173 ITAA sections and 201 distinct source pages. This
# is the real size of the drawn-operator problem; the 67 positions in /tmp/operator-worklist.json were
# a small gate-derived subset whose characters the gate had wrong.
FORMULA_FENCE = re.compile(r"```ingest-formula source=(\S+) page=(\d+)")
# Operators that SURVIVE extraction, so their presence means the structure is not lost.
# The en dash (U+2013) is the printed subtraction in these formulas and it does come through:
# PDF-verified on the source pages named by the fences - 40-75 vol02 p49 prints "365 – 25" and
# its fence contains the en dash, 104-95 vol03 p228 prints "$5,000 – $4,500" likewise. Adding it
# (2026-09-22) removed 15 of 80 findings that were reporting a formula whose only missing glyph
# was the multiplication sign, i.e. they were counting a printed operator as an absent one.
# DELIBERATELY NOT operators, though they occur in fences:
#   '*'  the defined-term marker the Act prints on the first occurrence of a term (*All Groups,
#        *exempt income) - 40 of the 80 findings contain one and none of them is arithmetic;
#   '-'  an intra-word hyphen ("Write-off days in income year") - 23 of the 80;
#   'x'  a letter inside a word ("expenditure", "tax") - 0 standalone occurrences corpus-wide.
# This class is therefore a FLOOR on the drawn-operator problem, not a measurement: a fence that
# kept its en dash and lost its multiplication sign is no longer reported. The restore workstream
# reads operators off the page (scripts/apply_operator_proposal.py, OPERATORS = "×÷−–—+=-≤≥±<>,*")

# ══ C17-C27: the classes the 2026-09-25 plan measured but no detector covered ══
# Every one of these was measured at HEAD on 2026-09-26 by RUNNING it; the count in each
# docstring is that measurement, next to the plan's number where they differ. Each has a
# self-test in scripts/test_c2X_*.py with one planted positive and one planted negative
# (phase 4 of scripts/final_data_audit.py runs them nightly), because a detector that
# cannot fail is decoration.

# ── C17 (CDN-0124): a corps section body that starts at (a)/(b) - the chapeau is gone ──
# ingest_corps_act.py's stray-heading fallback (:286-303) deletes any first line under 120
# characters unless it starts with '(', 'Note:', 'Example:', 'In this Act:', 'Where ' or
# 'If '. A chapeau ending "...provided by others If:" has no trailing space after 'If', so
# it does not match 'If ' and is deleted with the other ~403 real opening words; the file
# then begins at the first item marker. The fix is the ingest, not the corpus: this reports.
# Measured 2026-09-26: 313 findings - exactly the plan's 313, all in corporations-act-2001
# (itaa-1997/itaa-1936/gst-1999 have 0).

# Amendment history" block landed inside the act's last section as one flattened line; the
# OECD table of contents leaked into c31-32 as a spaced dot leader.
#
# The plan's first draft of this rule ("5+ dots in a line longer than 2,000 characters, or after
# an Endnote heading") fires 18 times in 11 files, and 15 of those are the legitimate population
# the same plan says must not fire: the itAA-1997 Div 10/11/12 checklists, the master-GST-guide
# checklists and glossary, and the MTG rate layouts are also single long flattened lines with dot
# leaders. What separates them is the CONTEXT, not the length: the artefact line is endnote text,
# so an Endnote heading or amendment-history wording sits in it or just above it. With that
# requirement the class fires on exactly the 3 files the plan named - gst-1999/195-1.md:2483,
# sis-1993/381.md:772 and fbt-1986/167.md:809 (measured 2026-09-26: 18 rows, 11 -> 3 files at
# first cut; see the commit) - and 381.md:775 still fires from the block context.

# ── C27 (S4): a section file no tree/index references ──────────────────────
# master-tax-examples carries 23 slug-length twins whose bodies are identical to a registered
# section: two slug generations were written in one regeneration (19068816f) and only one was
# registered. The general check is what catches the next generation, so it runs on every act
# with a tree/index - triage the orphans it finds, never bulk-delete them.
# Measured 2026-09-26: 23 findings, all in master-tax-examples (310 registered + 23 unregistered
# = 333 files) - the plan's exact figure. No other act has an orphan.

# scan_page_rule_artifacts (C16), both of which main() did call - so C15/C16 were dark at
# night and C5_body_fragments was dark in the standalone scanner. Every detector added below
