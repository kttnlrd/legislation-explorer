"""Inventory formula fences in ITAA 1997 and find which are MISSING an operator.

The re-ingest keeps a region it cannot prove is a table as a fenced block whose marker names its own
source page:

    ```ingest-formula source=vol08.pdf page=160
    Owned deductions + Acquired deductions        *Corporate tax rate
    ```

That marker is the reliable locator - unlike /tmp/operator-worklist.json, whose section-to-page
mapping the ingest gate refuses (R0_section_located) and whose expected characters came from the gate
rather than the page. Drawn operators are absent from the text layer, so a formula whose terms are
separated only by spaces is a formula missing its operators.

Heuristic for 'missing operator': a fence line with two or more runs separated by a wide gap (2+
spaces) or containing a term followed directly by a capitalised defined term ('*Corporate tax rate'),
where no operator character appears between them. Reported with the source page so each one can be
read and fixed individually. Nothing is written here.
