dictionary_utils.py — shared helpers for detecting where a new dictionary
definition begins in PDF-derived text.

Used by the parse_*.py structural parsers so that the big "Dictionary" sections
(ITAA 1997 s 995-1, GST Act s 195-1, ITAA 1936 s 6) split each defined term onto
its own paragraph instead of merging dozens of definitions into one run-on line.
